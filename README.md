## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the main challenges that I faced was adding a GitHub repository. This is my very first time working with GitHub, and whenever I would try to implement it, I would get a blank file (All I had to do was move my folder in a different path). 
Something else that I found myself struggling with is finding the Assistant Editor, but all I had to do in order to solve that was go to Editor and click on Assistant!
